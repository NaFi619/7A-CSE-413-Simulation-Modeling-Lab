Student's Assignment 1: Basic Matrix Operations
1. Create two 3×3 matrices with random integers in Python.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations on these matrices.
3. Compute the determinant, inverse, and rank of one of the matrices.

Student's Assignment 2: Matrix Plotting and
Visualization
1. Generate and Plot Two Random Vectors:
a. Create two vectors, each containing 15 random floats of your choice.
b. Plot these vectors on the same graph using matplotlib to compare how
they look.
c. Label the axes appropriately and give the plot a title.
2. Generate and Visualize a Random Matrix:
a. Create a 4x4 matrix with random values of your choice.
b. Display the matrix using a heatmap with appropriate color mapping (e.g.,
seaborn or matplotlib).
c. Add labels to the heatmap to indicate row and column numbers.
3. Matrix Operations and Visualization:
a. Create two 4x4 matrices with random values of your choice.
b. Perform the following operations:
i. Matrix Addition
ii. Matrix Subtraction
iii. Matrix Multiplication (ensure matrices are compatible for
multiplication)

c. For each of these operations, visualize the result using bar plots. Each bar
should represent one element of the matrix.

Rename the .ipynb file according to the previous task.
