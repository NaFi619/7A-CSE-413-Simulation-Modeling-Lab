🎯 Assignment for Simulation and Modeling Lab — Day 1
Course Code: CSE 413 
Level/Term: 4/1 
Credit: 3 
Instructor: Audity Ghosh 
Submission Deadline: 02/02/2026




✅ Tasks to Complete:
1. Scalar & Array Operations (Redo Section with Your Own Values):
·	Run the given code with scalar = 3.7 and a new array of at least 6 elements.
·	Show outputs of all built-in mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.).
2. 2×2 Matrix Calculations (Already Done in Class):
·	Study and understand the example code given for trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and rounding operations on a 2×2 matrix.



Task: Apply the Same Operations on a 3×2 Matrix
·	Create a 3×2 matrix with custom values.
·	Perform and display results of:
o	Trigonometric functions
o	Exponential & logarithmic functions
o	Absolute value & square root
o	Remainder when divided by 2
o	Rounding (round, floor, ceil)
📌 Make sure to clip inputs where needed to avoid math errors (e.g., arcsin/arccos domain issues).
4. Vector Functions
·	Understand the operations on the 1D vector shown in the notebook.



Task: Perform Same Operations on a 2×3 Matrix
·	Your 2×3 matrix can have float values (e.g., 2.1, 4.7…).
·	Implement and display:
o	Max & Min (with indices)
o	Vector length
o	Sorted version (both row-wise descending and entire matrix descending)
o	Sum, Product
o	Median, Mean, Standard Deviation
📌 Hint: Use np.sort() with axis=1 for row-wise sorting. Use .flatten() for entire matrix sorting.



🧠 Bonus (Optional for Extra Marks):
·	Try to visualize your matrix values using seaborn.heatmap() or matplotlib.
·	Try replacing static inputs with randomly generated numbers using np.random.uniform() or np.random.randint().
✅ Checklist Before Submission:
·	All code cells run without error.
·	Outputs are clearly visible.
·	You’ve added comments to explain key lines of code.
·	The .ipynb file is named like this: SIM_Lab1_YourName_StudentID.ipynb
